# Erdős–Rényi random graph generator and a Barabási–Albert random graph generator.

The Erdős–Rényi model also has an attempt of a Breadth First Search to calculate the size of the biggest diameter.
It also has the code to generate random ER graphs with an incrementing probabiity of connection to plot the emmergence of a Giant Component

The Barabasi-albert graph has Cummulative Binning applied to it and log-log regression.

This code was developed for the class of Network Science
